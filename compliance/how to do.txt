The reporting of all of this needs to be separate. This guy did something really good and created a role with the reporting.

I will need to build the first login to the device to gather all the details at the start. Building this in a fashion so i can add easy to it makes a lot of sense here.

first I need to a list of the NTP servers that are configured, register that to a temp list
- This may make sense to use specific modules and start easy

then compare the list of ntp servers to the list of expected ntp servers (if my list is different may be hard)






template with variable 

for server in servers
ntp server '{{ntp_server}}'
end for 

Different types of parsers
- Native Ansible galaxy cisco
- Genie parser
- NTC_templates parser 
- Napalm parser 

Options for Validation
- Ansible built-in asserts
- Napalm Validation - not really going to work for everything i want.
- compare to a template??
- Some custom solution?
