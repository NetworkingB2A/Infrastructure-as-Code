tips
Avoid using the vars directory in the role unless you are absolutely sure you want that variable. 
Here is the variable precedence

Understanding variable precedenceÔÉÅ
Ansible does apply variable precedence, and you might have a use for it. Here is the order of precedence from least to greatest (the last listed variables override all other variables):

1. command line values (for example, -u my_user, these are not variables)
2. role defaults (as defined in Role directory structure) 1
3. inventory file or script group vars 2
4. inventory group_vars/all 3
5. playbook group_vars/all 3
6. inventory group_vars/* 3
7. playbook group_vars/* 3
8. inventory file or script host vars 2
9. inventory host_vars/* 3
10. playbook host_vars/* 3
11. host facts / cached set_facts 4
12. play vars
13. play vars_prompt
14. play vars_files
15. role vars (as defined in Role directory structure)
16. block vars (only for tasks in block)
17. task vars (only for the task)
18. include_vars
19. set_facts / registered vars
20. role (and include_role) params
21. include params
22. extra vars (for example, -e "user=my_user")(always win precedence)
